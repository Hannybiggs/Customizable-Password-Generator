# Password Generator

The intent of this project was to modify given starter code to create a random password generator. By combining the aesthetic elements of HTML and CSS and employing Javascript to power the specifications of the password generator, the end result contains the following requested options:

## Password Generator Options:
- Choose between 8 and 128 characters
- Choose to include uppercase characters
- Choose to include lowercase characters
- Choose to include special symbols

## Results: 
The added Javascript code resulted in the required criteria being met. The Javascript enables the user to opt in or out of the above choice by clicking "OK" or "Cancel" in the prompts provided depending on the user's preference. The secure password is then generated in the box embedded on the page and can be copied for use.
